# Zomato Dataset Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing the Zomato dataset, sourced from Kaggle, which contains approximately 57,000 records of restaurant information. The goal of this project is to perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and utilize machine learning techniques to gain insights into the restaurant industry.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is obtained from Kaggle and consists of comprehensive information about restaurants, including their location, cuisine type, cost for two people, user ratings, and more. The dataset provides a valuable resource for conducting in-depth analysis and extracting meaningful insights.The link for the same is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/himanshupoddar/zomato-bangalore-restaurants

## Features

- Data Cleaning: The dataset may contain missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers. The project includes a thorough data cleaning process to ensure the data's quality and integrity before analysis.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The EDA phase aims to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the dataset. Various visualizations, such as bar graphs, pie charts, and scatter plots, are utilized to present key insights and observations.

- Machine Learning Models: The project employs machine learning techniques using the scikit-learn library. In particular, a linear regression model is implemented to predict certain aspects of the restaurant industry, such as ratings based on different features.

## Libraries Used

- Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis, including data cleaning and preprocessing.

- Matplotlib: Utilized for generating visualizations such as bar graphs and pie charts to illustrate patterns and trends within the data.

- scikit-learn: Employed for implementing machine learning models, including linear regression, to make predictions based on the dataset's features.

## How to Run the Project

1. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (Pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn).

2. Download the Zomato dataset from Kaggle and place it in the project directory 

3. Run the project's Python script, ensuring that the dataset's file path is correctly specified.

4. The script will perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and generate visualizations.

5. Machine learning models, such as linear regression, will be trained and evaluated based on the dataset's features.

## Results and Insights

Document the key findings, insights, and conclusions drawn from the project's analysis. Highlight any significant relationships, trends, or predictions made using the Zomato dataset.

## Future Improvements

Identify areas for future improvement or expansion of the project. This may include incorporating additional features, exploring different machine learning models, or conducting further analysis on specific aspects of the restaurant industry.
